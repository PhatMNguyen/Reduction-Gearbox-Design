The goal in the gear box design project is to design a prototype gearbox that will allow the hoist 
drum of a crane to elevate loads of up to 7.5 T at a maximum speed of 30 ft/min. We know that 
an electric motor will be used at it is rated at 15HP at 1800 RPM. The theoretical gearbox used 
will reduce the input speed and increase the torque on the output shaft.
